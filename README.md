# Community Events
Hello. This is the repo for all the content relating to my sessions which do not have a repo of their own. If you have attend a session of mine before then you have my thanks. If you have any questions, or you need support. Please let me know.  

I am on a personal mission to educate Data Scientists on best-practices from engineering. When I interview Data Scientists I will ask them about a model they built which had a benefit. I will then ask how they deployed it. This is often met with blank looks and hushed mentioned that either the model was never deployed or it was deployed by the data engineering team. Heed my advice <b> learn how to deploy a model </b>. It is not enough to be able to write models anymore. The unicorns are on the rise! 

All the sessions are listed under the event in which they were given at. If there were multiple sessions at one event, they will be under the same folder.
